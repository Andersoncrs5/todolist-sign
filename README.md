# Todolist with authentication and authorization

Project Description:

This project is a To-Do List Application built with Spring Boot (version 3.4.2) and designed to provide a 
user-friendly interface for managing tasks and users. The application includes two key CRUD (Create, Read, 
Update, Delete) functionalities for both users and tasks, with built-in authentication and authorization 
mechanisms to secure access.

Key Features:

Spring Boot (Version 3.4.2): The core of the application is built using Spring Boot, which provides a robust and 
scalable framework for developing Java applications with minimal configuration. It allows seamless integration 
of various features such as authentication, JPA, and Swagger.

H2 Database: The application uses an H2 in-memory database, providing an embedded, lightweight solution for 
development and testing purposes. H2 ensures fast development cycles and simplifies the deployment process 
for smaller-scale applications.

JPA (Java Persistence API): The application utilizes JPA for managing the persistence layer. JPA allows for 
easy mapping between Java objects and relational database tables, enabling efficient data storage and 
retrieval. It supports the use of repositories for both User and Task entities, making the CRUD operations 
straightforward and highly maintainable.


Swagger 2.8.4: The API is fully documented using Swagger, enabling developers and users to easily test and 
interact with the applicationâ€™s endpoints.

# Todolist with authentication and authorization

Project Description:

This project is a To-Do List Application built with Spring Boot (version 3.4.2) and designed to provide a 
user-friendly interface for managing tasks and users. The application includes two key CRUD (Create, Read, 
Update, Delete) functionalities for both users and tasks, with built-in authentication and authorization 
mechanisms to secure access.

Key Features:

Spring Boot (Version 3.4.2): The core of the application is built using Spring Boot, which provides a robust and 
scalable framework for developing Java applications with minimal configuration. 

H2 Database: The application uses an H2 in-memory database, providing an embedded, lightweight solution for 
development and testing purposes.

JPA (Java Persistence API): The application utilizes JPA for managing the persistence layer. JPA allows for 
easy mapping between Java objects and relational database tables, enabling efficient data storage and 
retrieval. 

Swagger 2.8.4: The API is fully documented using Swagger, enabling developers and users to easily test and 
interact with the applicationâ€™s endpoints.
